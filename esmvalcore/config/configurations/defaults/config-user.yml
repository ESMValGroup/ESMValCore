# Automatic data download from ESGF --- [never]/when_missing/always
# Use automatic download of missing CMIP3, CMIP5, CMIP6, CORDEX, and obs4MIPs
# data from ESGF. ``never`` disables this feature, which is useful if you are
# working on a computer without an internet connection, or if you have limited
# disk space. ``when_missing`` enables the automatic download for files that
# are not available locally. ``always`` will always check ESGF for the latest
# version of a file, and will only use local files if they correspond to that
# latest version.

# memory you need for that by inspecting the file ``run/resource_usage.txt`` in
