# Automatic data download from ESGF --- [never]/when_missing/always
# Use automatic download of missing CMIP3, CMIP5, CMIP6, CORDEX, and obs4MIPs
# data from ESGF. ``never`` disables this feature, which is useful if you are
# working on a computer without an internet connection, or if you have limited
# disk space. ``when_missing`` enables the automatic download for files that
# are not available locally. ``always`` will always check ESGF for the latest
# version of a file, and will only use local files if they correspond to that
# latest version.
search_esgf: never

# Directory for storing downloaded climate data
# Make sure to use a directory where you can store multiple GBs of data. Your
# home directory on a HPC is usually not suited for this purpose, so please
# change the default value in this case!

# Run at most this many tasks in parallel --- [null]/1/2/3/4/...
# Set to ``null`` to use the number of available CPUs. If you run out of
# memory, try setting max_parallel_tasks to ``1`` and check the amount of
# memory you need for that by inspecting the file ``run/resource_usage.txt`` in
# the output directory. Using the number there you can increase the number of
# parallel tasks again to a reasonable number for the amount of memory
# available in your system.

# Remove the ``preproc`` directory if the run was successful --- [true]/false

# will be removed after a successful run. Set to ``false`` if you need those
# files.

# Use netCDF compression --- true/[false]

# A profiler tells you which functions in your code take most time to run.
