# 3hr data between historical and scenario cannot be concatenated because historical 
# finishes at 
# Cell(point=cftime.DatetimeGregorian(2005, 12, 31, 21, 0, 0, 0, has_year_zero=False), bound=None)
# and scenario finishes at
# Cell(point=cftime.DatetimeGregorian(2006, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, has_year_zero=False), bound=None)
# which is 6h apart instead of 3h
