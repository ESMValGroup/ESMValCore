Installation
============

Conda installation
------------------

In order to install the Conda package, you will need to install conda first.
For a minimal conda installation go to https://conda.io/miniconda.html.
It is recommended that you always use the latest version of conda, as problems have been reported when trying to use older versions.

Once you have installed conda, you can install ESMValCore by running:

.. code-block:: bash


    conda install -c esmvalgroup -c conda-forge esmvalcore


Docker installation
-----------------------

ESMValCore is also provided through `DockerHub <https://hub.docker.com/u/esmvalgroup/>`_
in the form of docker containers.
See https://docs.docker.com for more information about docker containers and how to
run them.

You can get the latest release with

.. code-block:: bash

   docker pull esmvalgroup/esmvalcore:stable

If you want to use the current master branch, use

.. code-block:: bash

   docker pull esmvalgroup/esmvalcore:latest

To run a container using those images, use:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run esmvalgroup/esmvalcore:stable --help

Note that the container does not see the data or environmental variables available in the host by default.
You can make data available with ``-v /path:/path/in/container`` and environmental variables with ``-e VARNAME``.

For example, the following command would run a recipe

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run -e HOME -v "$HOME":"$HOME" -v /data:/data esmvalgroup/esmvalcore:stable -c ~/config-user.yml ~/recipes/recipe_example.yml

with the environmental variable ``$HOME`` available inside the container and the data
in the directories ``$HOME`` and ``/data``, so these can be used to find the configuration file, recipe, and data.

It might be useful to define a `bash alias
<https://opensource.com/article/19/7/bash-aliases>`_
or script to abbreviate the above command, for example

.. code-block:: bash

	 alias esmvaltool="docker run -e HOME -v $HOME:$HOME -v /data:/data esmvalgroup/esmvalcore:stable"

would allow using the ``esmvaltool`` command without even noticing that the tool is running inside a Docker container.


Singularity installation
----------------------------

Docker is usually forbidden in clusters due to security reasons. However,
there is a more secure alternative to run containers that is usually available
on them: `Singularity <https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/quick_start.html>`_.

Singularity can use docker containers directly from DockerHub with the
following command

.. code-block:: bash

   singularity run docker://esmvalgroup/esmvalcore:stable -c ~/config-user.yml ~/recipes/recipe_example.yml

Note that the container does not see the data available in the host by default.
You can make host data available with ``-B /path:/path/in/container``.

It might be useful to define a `bash alias
<https://opensource.com/article/19/7/bash-aliases>`_
or script to abbreviate the above command, for example

.. code-block:: bash

	 alias esmvaltool="singularity run -B $HOME:$HOME -B /data:/data docker://esmvalgroup/esmvalcore:stable"

would allow using the ``esmvaltool`` command without even noticing that the tool is running inside a Singularity container.

Some clusters may not allow to connect to external services, in those cases
you can first create a singularity image locally:

.. code-block:: bash

   singularity build esmvalcore.sif docker://esmvalgroup/esmvalcore:stable

and then upload the image file ``esmvalcore.sif`` to the cluster.
To run the container using the image file ``esmvalcore.sif`` use:

.. code-block:: bash

   singularity run esmvalcore.sif -c ~/config-user.yml ~/recipes/recipe_example.yml




Development installation
------------------------

To install from source for development, follow these instructions.

-  `Download and install
   conda <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html>`__
   (this should be done even if the system in use already has a
   preinstalled version of conda, as problems have been reported with
   using older versions of conda)
-  To make the ``conda`` command available, add
   ``source <prefix>/etc/profile.d/conda.sh`` to your ``.bashrc`` file
   and restart your shell. If using (t)csh shell, add
   ``source <prefix>/etc/profile.d/conda.csh`` to your
   ``.cshrc``/``.tcshrc`` file instead.
-  Update conda: ``conda update -y conda``
-  Clone the ESMValCore Git repository:
   ``git clone git@github.com:ESMValGroup/ESMValCore``
-  Go to the source code directory: ``cd ESMValCore``
-  Create the esmvalcore conda environment
   ``conda env create --name esmvalcore --file environment.yml``
-  Activate the esmvalcore environment: ``conda activate esmvalcore``
-  Install in development mode: ``pip install -e '.[develop]'``. If you
   are installing behind a proxy that does not trust the usual pip-urls
   you can declare them with the option ``--trusted-host``,
   e.g.Â \ ``pip install --trusted-host=pypi.python.org --trusted-host=pypi.org --trusted-host=files.pythonhosted.org -e .[develop]``
-  Test that your installation was successful by running
   ``esmvaltool -h``.
