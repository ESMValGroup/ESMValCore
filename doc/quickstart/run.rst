Running
*******

The ESMValCore package provides the ``esmvaltool`` command line tool, which can
be used to run a :doc:`recipe <../recipe/index>`.

To run a recipe, call ``esmvaltool run`` with the desired recipe:
.. code:: bash

	esmvaltool run recipe_python.yml

If the config user is not in the default ``{HOME}\.esmvaltool\`` path you can
pass its path explicitly:

.. code:: bash

	esmvaltool run --config_file /path/to/config-user.yml recipe_python.yml

It is also possible to explicitly change values from the config file using flags:

.. code:: bash

	esmvaltool run --argument_name argument_value recipe_python.yml

To get help on additional commands, please use

.. code:: bash

	esmvaltool --help


.. note::

	ESMValTool command line interface is created using the Fire python package.
	This package supports the creation of completion scripts for the Bash and
	Fish shells. Go to https://google.github.io/python-fire/using-cli/#python-fires-flags
	to learn how to set up them.
