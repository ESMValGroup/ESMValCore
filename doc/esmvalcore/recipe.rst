Overview
========

After ``config-user.yml``, the ``recipe.yml`` is the second file the user needs
to pass to ``esmvaltool`` as command line option, at each run time point.
Recipes contain the data and data analysis information and instructions needed
to run the diagnostic(s), as well as specific diagnostic-related instructions.

Broadly, recipes contain a general section summarizing the provenance and
functionality of the diagnostics, the datasets which need to be run, the
preprocessors that need to be applied, and the diagnostics which need to be run
over the preprocessed data. This information is provided to ESMValTool in four
main recipe sections: Documentation_, Datasets_, Preprocessors_ and
Diagnostics_, respectively.

.. _Documentation:

Recipe section: ``documentation``
=================================

The documentation section includes:

- The recipe's author's user name (``authors``, matching the definitions in the
  :ref:`config-ref`)
- A description of the recipe (``description``, written in MarkDown format)
- A list of scientific references (``references``, matching the definitions in
  the :ref:`config-ref`)
- the project or projects associated with the recipe (``projects``, matching
  the definitions in the :ref:`config-ref`)

For example, the documentation section of ``recipes/recipe_ocean_amoc.yml`` is
the following:

.. code-block:: yaml

    documentation:
      description: |
        Recipe to produce time series figures of the derived variable, the
        Atlantic meriodinal overturning circulation (AMOC).
        This recipe also produces transect figures of the stream functions for
        the years 2001-2004.

      authors:
        - demo_le

      maintainer:
        - demo_le

      references:
        - demora2018gmd

      projects:
        - ukesm

.. note::

   Note that all authors, projects, and references mentioned in the description
   section of the recipe need to be included in the ``config-references.yml``
   file. The author name uses the format: ``surname_name``. For instance, John
   Doe would be: ``doe_john``. This information can be omitted by new users
   whose name is not yet included in ``config-references.yml``.

.. _Datasets:

Recipe section: ``datasets``
============================

The ``datasets`` section includes dictionaries that, via key-value pairs, define standardized
data specifications:

- dataset name (key ``dataset``, value e.g. ``MPI-ESM-LR`` or ``UKESM1-0-LL``)
- project (key ``project``, value ``CMIP5`` or ``CMIP6`` for CMIP data,
  ``OBS`` for observational data, ``ana4mips`` for ana4mips data,
  ``obs4mips`` for obs4mips data, ``EMAC`` for EMAC data)
- experiment (key ``exp``, value e.g. ``historical``, ``amip``, ``piControl``,
  ``RCP8.5``)
- mip (for CMIP data, key ``mip``, value e.g. ``Amon``, ``Omon``, ``LImon``)
- ensemble member (key ``ensemble``, value e.g. ``r1i1p1``, ``r1i1p1f1``)
- time range (e.g. key-value ``start_year: 1982``, ``end_year: 1990``)
- model grid (native grid ``grid: gn`` or regridded grid ``grid: gr``, for
  CMIP6 data only).

For example, a datasets section could be:

.. code-block:: yaml

    datasets:
      - {dataset: CanESM2, project: CMIP5, exp: historical, ensemble: r1i1p1, start_year: 2001, end_year: 2004}
      - {dataset: UKESM1-0-LL, project: CMIP6, exp: historical, ensemble: r1i1p1f2, start_year: 2001, end_year: 2004, grid: gn}
      - {dataset: EC-EARTH3, alias: custom_alias, project: CMIP6, exp: historical, ensemble: r1i1p1f1, start_year: 2001, end_year: 2004, grid: gn}

It is possible to define the experiment as a list to concatenate two experiments.
Here it is an example concatenating the `historical` experiment with `rcp85`

.. code-block:: yaml

    datasets:
      - {dataset: CanESM2, project: CMIP5, exp: [historical, rcp85] ensemble: r1i1p1, start_year: 2001, end_year: 2004}

It is also possible to define the ensemble as a list, although it is useful only
case the two experiments have different ensemble names

.. code-block:: yaml

    datasets:
      - {dataset: CanESM2, project: CMIP5, exp: [historical, rcp85] ensemble: [r1i1p1, r1i2p1], start_year: 2001, end_year: 2004}

Note that this section is not required, as datasets can also be provided in the
Diagnostics_ section.

.. _Preprocessors:

Recipe section: ``preprocessors``
=================================

The preprocessor section of the recipe includes one or more preprocesors, each
of which may call the execution of one or several preprocessor functions.

Each preprocessor section includes:

- A preprocessor name (any name, under ``preprocessors``);
- A list of preprocesor steps to be executed (choose from the API);
- Any or none arguments given to the preprocessor steps;
- The order that the preprocesor steps are applied can also be specified using
  the ``custom_order`` preprocesor function.

The following snippet is an example of a preprocessor named ``prep_map`` that
contains multiple preprocessing steps (:ref:`Horizontal regridding` with two
arguments, :ref:`Time operations` with no arguments (i.e., calcualting the
average over the time dimension) and :ref:`Multi-model statistics` with two
arguments):

.. code-block:: yaml

    preprocessors:
      prep_map:
        regrid:
          target_grid: 1x1
          scheme: linear
        climate_statistics:
          operator: mean
        multi_model_statistics:
          span: overlap
          statistics: [mean ]

.. note::

   In this case no ``preprocessors`` section is needed the workflow will apply
   a ``default`` preprocessor consisting of only basic operations like: loading
   data, applying CMOR checks and fixes (:ref:`CMOR check and dataset-specific
   fixes`) and saving the data to disk.

.. _Diagnostics:

Recipe section: ``diagnostics``
===============================

The diagnostics section includes one or more diagnostics. Each diagnostics will
include:

- a list of which variables to load;
- a description of the variables (optional);
- the preprocessor to be applied to each variable;
- the script to be run;
- an optional ``additional_datasets`` section.

The ``additional_datasets`` can add datasets beyond those listed in the the
Datasets_ section. This is useful if specific datasets need to be used only by
a specific diagnostic. The ``additional_datasets`` can also be used to add
variable specific datasets. This is also a good way to add observational
datasets, which are usually variable-specific.

Running a simple diagnostic
---------------------------
The following example, taken from ``recipe_ocean_example.yml``, shows a
diagnostic named `diag_map`, which loads the temperature at the ocean surface
between the years 2001 and 2003 and then passes it to the ``prep_map``
preprocessor. The result of this process is then passed to the ocean diagnostic
map scipt, ``ocean/diagnostic_maps.py``.

.. code-block:: yaml

  diagnostics:

    diag_map:
      description: Global Ocean Surface regridded temperature map
      variables:
        tos: # Temperature at the ocean surface
          preprocessor: prep_map
          start_year: 2001
          end_year: 2003
      scripts:
        Global_Ocean_Surface_regrid_map:
          script: ocean/diagnostic_maps.py

To define a variable/dataset combination, the keys in the diagnostic section
are combined with the keys from datasets section. If two versions of the same
key are provided, then the key in the datasets section will take precedence
over the keys in variables section. For many recipes it makes more sense to
define the ``start_year`` and ``end_year`` items in the variable section,
because the diagnostic script assumes that all the data has the same time
range.

Note that the path to the script provided in the `script` option should be
either the absolute path to the script, or the path relative to the
``esmvaltool/diag_scripts`` directory.


Passing arguments to a diagnostic
---------------------------------
The ``diagnostics`` section may include a lot of arguments that can be used by
the diagnostic script; these arguments are stored at runtime in a dictionary
that is then made available to the diagnostic script via the interface link,
independent of the language the diagnostic script is written in. Here is an
example of such groups of arguments:

.. code-block:: yaml

    scripts:
      autoassess_strato_test_1: &autoassess_strato_test_1_settings
        script: autoassess/autoassess_area_base.py
        title: "Autoassess Stratosphere Diagnostic Metric MPI-MPI"
        area: stratosphere
        control_model: MPI-ESM-LR
        exp_model: MPI-ESM-MR
        obs_models: [ERA-Interim]  # list to hold models that are NOT for metrics but for obs operations
        additional_metrics: [ERA-Interim, inmcm4]  # list to hold additional datasets for metrics

In this example, apart from specifying the diagnostic script ``script:
autoassess/autoassess_area_base.py``, we pass a suite of parameters to be used
by the script (``area``, ``control_model`` etc). These parameters are stored in
key-value pairs in the diagnostic configuration file, an interface file that
can be used by importing the ``run_diagnostic`` utility:

.. code-block:: python

   from esmvaltool.diag_scripts.shared import run_diagnostic

   # write the diagnostic code here e.g.
   def run_some_diagnostic(my_area, my_control_model, my_exp_model):
       """Diagnostic to be run."""
       if my_area == 'stratosphere':
           diag = my_control_model / my_exp_model
           return diag

   def main(cfg):
       """Main diagnostic run function."""
       my_area = cfg['area']
       my_control_model = cfg['control_model']
       my_exp_model = cfg['exp_model']
       run_some_diagnostic(my_area, my_control_model, my_exp_model)

   if __name__ == '__main__':

       with run_diagnostic() as config:
           main(config)

This way a lot of the optional arguments necessary to a diagnostic are at the
user's control via the recipe.

Running your own diagnostic
---------------------------
If the user wants to test a newly-developed ``my_first_diagnostic.py`` which
is not yet part of the ESMValTool diagnostics library, he/she do it by passing
the absolute path to the diagnostic:

.. code-block:: yaml

  diagnostics:

    myFirstDiag:
      description: John Doe wrote a funny diagnostic
      variables:
        tos: # Temperature at the ocean surface
          preprocessor: prep_map
          start_year: 2001
          end_year: 2003
      scripts:
        JoeDiagFunny:
          script: /home/users/john_doe/esmvaltool_testing/my_first_diagnostic.py

This way the user may test a new diagnostic thoroughly before committing to the
GitHub repository and including it in the ESMValTool diagnostics library.

Re-using parameters from one ``script`` to another
--------------------------------------------------
Due to ``yaml`` features it is possible to recycle entire diagnostics sections
for use with other diagnostics. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    scripts:
      cycle: &cycle_settings
        script: perfmetrics/main.ncl
        plot_type: cycle
        time_avg: monthlyclim
      grading: &grading_settings
        <<: *cycle_settings
        plot_type: cycle_latlon
        calc_grading: true
        normalization: [centered_median, none]

In this example the hook ``&cycle_settings`` can be used to pass the ``cycle:``
parameters to ``grading:`` via the shortcut ``<<: *cycle_settings``.
