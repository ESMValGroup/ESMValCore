Dataset fixes
*************

Some (model) datasets contain (known) errors that would normally prevent them
from being processed correctly by the ESMValTool. The errors can be in
the metadata describing the dataset and/or in the actual data.
Typical examples of such errors are missing or wrong attributes (e.g.
attribute ''units'' says 1e-9 but data are actually in 1e-6), missing or
mislabeled coordinates (e.g. ''lev'' instead of ''plev'' or missing
coordinate bounds like ''lat_bnds'') or problems with the actual data
(e.g. cloud liquid water only instead of sum of liquid + ice as specified by the CMIP data request).

The ESMValTool can apply on the fly fixes to data sets that have
known errors that can be fixed automatically.

Fix structure
=============

Fixes are Python classes stored in ``esmvaltool/cmor/_fixes/[PROJECT]/[DATASET].py``
that derive from :class:`esmvalcore.cmor._fixes.fix.Fix` and
are named after the short name of the variable they fix. You can use the name
``AllVars`` if you want the fix to be applied to the whole dataset

.. warning::
    Be careful to replace any ``-`` with ``_`` in your dataset name.
    We need this replacement to have proper python module names.

The fixes are automatically loaded and applied when the dataset is preprocessed.

Fixing a dataset
================

To illustrate the process of creating a fix we are going to construct a new
one from scratch for a fictional dataset. We need to fix a CMIPX model
called PERFECT-MODEL that is reporting a missing latitude coordinate for
variable tas.

Check the output
----------------

Next to the error message, you should see some info about the iris cube: size,
coordinates. In our example it looks like this:

.. code-block::

    air_temperature/ (K) (time: 312; altitude: 90; longitude: 180)
        Dimension coordinates:
            time                                     x              -              -
            altitude                                 -              x              -
            longitude                                -              -              x
        Auxiliary coordinates:
            day_of_month                             x              -              -
            day_of_year                              x              -              -
            month_number                             x              -              -
            year                                     x              -              -
        Attributes:
            {'cmor_table': 'CMIPX', 'mip': 'Amon', 'short_name': 'tas', 'frequency': 'mon'})


So now the mistake is clear: the latitude coordinate is badly named and the
fix should just rename it.

Create the fix
--------------

We start by creating the module file. In our example the path will be
``esmvaltool/cmor/_fixes/CMIPX/PERFECT_MODEL.py``. If it already exists
just add the class to the file, there is no limit in the number of fixes
we can have in any given file.

Then we have to create the class for the fix deriving from
:class:`esmvalcore.cmor._fixes.Fix`

.. code-block:: python

    """Fixes for PERFECT-MODEL."""
    from esmvalcore.cmor.fix import Fix

    class tas(Fix):
         """Fixes for tas variable.""""

Next we must choose the method to use between the ones offered by the
Fix class:

- ``fix_file`` : should be used only to fix errors that prevent data loading.
  As a rule of thumb, you should only use it if the execution halts before
  reaching the checks.

- ``fix_metadata`` : you want to change something in the cube that is not
  the data (e.g variable or coordinate names, data units).

- ``fix_data``: you need to fix the data. Beware: coordinates data values are
  part of the metadata.

In our case we need to rename the coordinate ``altitude`` to ``latitude``,
so we will implement the ``fix_metadata`` method:

.. code-block:: python

    """Fixes for PERFECT-MODEL."""
    from esmvalcore.cmor.fix import Fix

    class tas(Fix):
        """Fixes for tas variable.""""

        def fix_metadata(self, cubes):
            """
            Fix metadata for tas.

            Fix the name of the latitude coordinate, which is called altitude
            in the original file.
            """"
            # Sometimes Iris will interpret the data as multiple cubes.
            # Good CMOR datasets will only show one but we support the
            # multiple cubes case to be able to fix the errors that are
            # leading to that extra cubes.
            # In our case this means that we can safely assume that the
            # tas cube is the first one
            tas_cube = cubes[0]
            latitude = tas_cube.coord('altitude')

            # Fix the names. Latitude values, units and
            latitude.short_name = 'lat'
            latitude.standard_name = 'latitude'
            latitude.long_name = 'latitude'

This will fix the error. The next time you run ESMValTool you will find that the error
is fixed on the fly and, hopefully, your recipe will run free of errors.

Sometimes other errors can appear after you fix the first one because they were
hidden by it. In our case, the latitude coordinate could have bad units or
values outside the valid range for example. Just extend your fix to address those
errors.

Finishing
---------

Chances are that you are not the only one that wants to use that dataset and
variable. Other users could take advantage of your fixes as
soon as possible. Please, create a separated pull request for the fix and
submit it.

It will also be very helpful if you just scan a couple of other variables from
the same dataset and check if they share this error. In case that you find that
it is a general one, you can change the fix name to ``AllVars`` so it gets
executed for all variables in the dataset. If you find that this is shared only by
a handful of similar vars you can just make the fix for those new vars derive
from the one you just created:

.. code-block:: python

    """Fixes for PERFECT-MODEL."""
    from esmvalcore.cmor.fix import Fix

    class tas(Fix):
        """Fixes for tas variable.""""

        def fix_metadata(self, cubes):
            """
            Fix metadata for tas.

            Fix the name of the latitude coordinate, which is called altitude
            in the original file.
            """"
            # Sometimes Iris will interpret the data as multiple cubes.
            # Good CMOR datasets will only show one but we support the
            # multiple cubes case to be able to fix the errors that are
            # leading to that extra cubes.
            # In our case this means that we can safely assume that the
            # tas cube is the first one
            tas_cube = cubes[0]
            latitude = tas_cube.coord('altitude')

            # Fix the names. Latitude values, units and
            latitude.short_name = 'lat'
            latitude.standard_name = 'latitude'
            latitude.long_name = 'latitude'


    class ps(tas):
        """Fixes for ps variable."""


Common errors
=============

The above example covers one of the most common cases: variables / coordinates that
have names that do not match the expected. But there are some others that use
to appear frequently. This section describes the most common cases.

Bad units declared
------------------

It is quite common that a variable declares to be using some units but the data
is stored in another. This can be solved by overwriting the units attribute
with the actual data units.

.. code-block:: python

    ...
        def fix_metadata(self, cubes):
            ...
            cube.units = 'real_units'
            ...

Detecting this error can be tricky if the units are similar enough. It also
has a good chance of going undetected until you notice strange results in
your diagnostic.


Coordinates missing
-------------------

Another common error is to have missing coordinates. Usually it just means
that the file does not follow the CF-conventions and Iris can therefore not interpret it.

If this is the case, you should see a warning from the ESMValTool about
discarding some cubes in the fix metadata step. Just before that warning you
should see the full list of cubes as read by Iris. If that list contains your
missing coordinate you can create a fix for this model:

.. code-block:: bash

    def fix_metadata(self, cubes):
        coord_cube = cubes.extract_strict('COORDINATE_NAME')
        # Usually this will correspond to an auxiliary coordinate
        # because the most common error is to forget adding it to the
        # coordinates attribute
        coord = iris.coords.AuxCoord(
            coord_cube.data,
            var_name=coord_cube.var_name,
            standard_name=coord_cube.standard_name,
            long_name=coord_cube.long_name,
            units=coord_cube.units,
        }

        # It may also have bounds as another cube
        coord.bounds = cubes.extract_strict('BOUNDS_NAME').data
